## 0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL
`Group project` `Python` `OOP` `Back-end` `SQL` `MySQL` `ORM` `SQLAlchemy`

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* What is `*args` and how to use it
* What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function
* How to create a MySQL database
* How to create a MySQL user and grant it privileges
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
* How to handle 2 different storage engines with the same codebase
* How to use environment variables

## Requirements
* Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu `20.04` LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and `python3 -c` 'print(`__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)


## Description of the project
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. The aim of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:

* `A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)`
* `A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities`
* `A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities`
* `An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.`
